    "   - `count_sentences(text)`: Count sentences (assume sentences end with '.', '!', or '?')\n",
    "   - `count_paragraphs(text)`: Count paragraphs (separated by double newlines)\n",
    "   - `most_common_word(text)`: Find the most frequently used word (ignore case)\n",
    "   - `average_word_length(text)`: Calculate average length of words\n",
    "   - `find_long_words(text, min_length)`: Find all words longer than specified length\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clean the text by removing punctuation when counting words\n",
